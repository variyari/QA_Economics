I started with getting elements stored in variables rather than hard coding them is scripts.
Have made a separate ini file - testdata.ini in feature/step_definition directory.

Then making some basic scenarios for getting element displayed.
Then making some commom functions for clicking an element and verifying title of current page in 
support/world/index.js file.

Have used dynamic waits in my scripts instead of static wait and sleep function.
