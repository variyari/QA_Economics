--Iteration1
I started with getting elements stored in variables rather than hard coding them is scripts.
Have made a separate ini file - testdata.ini in feature/step_definition directory.

Then making some basic scenarios for getting element displayed.
Then making some commom functions for clicking an element and verifying title of current page in 
support/world/index.js file.

Have used dynamic waits in my scripts instead of static wait and sleep function.

--Iteration2
Added reporting mechanism using cucumber-html report
Run node node_modules/cucumber/bin/cucumber-js --format json:test/cucumber_report.json to run sample tests.
and then run node report.js in order to generate html file.

Also added scenario to test 'Browse Job by sectors'
Values of expected jobs are passed through dataTable.
Can also be tested via matching result from database and UI.
--End

--Improvements
Would have liked to incorporate Page Object Style Model i.e. maintaining objects and functions of one page using one 
class.
